# 🎧 Podcast Listenning Time Prediction
Welcome to my Data Science mini-project based on the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series** challenge!

## 📌 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline to predict the **listening time** of a podcast episode, applying best practices in software development and DevOps with GitHub features.

This project also serves as a demonstration of my understanding of:
- GitHub Copilot
- GitHub Codespaces
- GitHub Actions with CodeQL
- GitHub Projects (Kanban)

## 📂 Dataset Used

The dataset comes from the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series**.

- **Source**: [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4)
- **Target variable**: `listening_Time_minutes`
- **Features** include podcast metadata such as duration, publication time, etc.

## 🔬 Pipeline Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation matrix

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature encoding and scaling

3. **Model Training**:
   - Regression models (e.g. XGBoost)
   - Evaluation using RMSE and R² metrics

4. **Model Testing**:
   - Unit tests for reproducibility and validation

5. **CI/CD & Code Scanning**:
   - CodeQL integrated for static security analysis via GitHub Actions

## 🚀 GitHub Integration

- ✅ Codespaces enabled for instant development
- ✅ GitHub Project board for task tracking (Kanban)
- ✅ CodeQL scan set up on every commit
- ✅ GitHub Copilot used to assist in writing utility functions and cleaning code
